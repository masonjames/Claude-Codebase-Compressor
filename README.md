Random experiments using Claude to compress code repositories to a JSON fioe that can be used in later conversations.  

Examples are in the analysis_resluts folder. Upload to a new Claude 3.5 Sonnet chat and it should recognize the repository as well as the important components of the file.

The files in the root directory are 3 different examples of what Claude and I came up with though never got it working 100% of the time.
